              June 3rd 2016 <br>
              Today I am burdened by my sin <br>
              I am in need of your grace, <br>
              I’m completely unworthy of it. <br>
              Sometimes I can’t recognize myself in the mirror<br>
              I begin to question my life <br>
              And in many ways I try to be you<br>
              Not try to be like you.<br>
              I pray that one day I will no longer be this wicked<br>
              I know that you are calling me to yourself<br>
              And wisdom starts with obedience to you<br>
              I cannot stop running from you<br>
              Thank you for always calling me back to yourself<br>
              I am thankful that it is by your grace that I am saved.<br><br>

              I cried out for you to take me<br>
              And to swallow me whole<br>
              Who is this man, That I’ve come to know<br>
              I keep on running from you<br>
              But your grace consumes me<br>
              I'm tired of comparing myself to the man that reflects me<br><br>

              So cast me out to sea, all I want is to flee<br>
              Just let the waves consume me<br>
              All The waters closed in around me<br>

              So cast me out to sea <br>

              So cast me out to sea<br><br>

              You are the one that moved mountains before you,<br>
              You are the one who can part the seas<br>

              Who am I to think I’m before you?<br>
              Who am I to think I am king?<br>

              Who am I to think I am before you?<br>
              Who am I to think that I am king?<br><br>

              Jonah 2:3<br>
              For you cast me into the deep,<br>
              into the heart of the seas,<br>
              and the flood surrounded me;<br>
              all your waves and your billows
              passed over me.</p>

            <hr class="mb">
            <p class="white-text lyrics">
              Wake up, look around you <br>
              All that you see is created <br>
              Even what you use to see <br> <br>

              How could you look at a sun rise <br>
              How could you gaze upon the sea <br>
              When you see the stars that kiss the sky <br>
              And all of the life on earth <br> <br>

              Yet you deny, the deity of Christ <br>
              What a kind creator, <br>
              He has given us life <br>
              The very breath in your lungs <br>
              Is a gift of mercy <br>
              My Friend stop suppressing the truth <br> <br>

              You know of God <br>
              You know him to be truth. <br>
              Just because you say he isn’t there <br>
              Doesn’t mean he doesn’t exist <br>
              It’s no different than turning on a light <br>
              And saying it’s off <br> <br>

              Start to drink of living water <br>
              Come to him, you will never starve again <br>
              He has extended his hands <br>
              They were pierced for our sins <br> <br>

              If there was no God, then why are you moral <br>
              What is the point if we are all just stardust <br>
              See stardust has no value just bumping around <br>
              But you do have Value <br>
              Just as all humans do <br>
              Why does it matter when someone steals from you <br>
              Why does it matter when someone lies to you? <br>
              See you know these things are wrong <br> <br>

              Because He told them to you <br>
              Why do you continue to walk around <br>
              Like a walking dead man <br>
              When God can breathe life into your dry bones? <br>
              He is reaching out for you <br> <br>

              What makes you king? <br>
              Just look and you will see <br>

              You don’t make truth <br>
              Truth comes from God <br>

              You don’t make truth <br>
              Truth comes from God <br>

              The mountains that touch the sky <br>
              The trees that bury their roots <br>
              God has made all that is around you <br>
              And you were made to bear his image <br>
              You were made for his Glory <br> <br>

              Yet you deny, the deity of Christ <br>
              What a kind creator, <br>
              He has given us life <br>
              The very breath in your lungs <br>
              Is a gift of mercy <br>
              My Friend stop suppressing the truth <br> <br>

              You know of God <br>
              You know him to be truth. <br>
              Just because you say he isn’t there <br>
              Doesn’t mean he doesn’t exist <br>
              It’s no different than turning on a light <br>
              And saying it’s off <br> <br>

              Start to drink of living water <br>
              Come to him, you will never starve again <br>
              He has extended his hands <br>
              They were pierced for our sins <br> <br>

              I’m begging you to come to reason <br>
              Understand the folly of your ways <br>
              See we aren’t so different <br>
              I too sin <br>
              At one time a suppressed it too <br>
              I loved myself more than others <br>
              I was enslaved too <br>
              But God is greater than my sin <br>
              He has provided a way <br>
              And that way is Jesus Christ <br>
              Cast all your burdens on him <br>
              By grace we are saved <br>
              Granted at the gifting of Faith <br>
              Call upon the name of the Lord <br>
              And know peace for once in your life. <br>
              Know peace. <br> <br>

              Acts 2:21 <br>
              And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <br>

              A son of the most high<br>
              Who am I<br> <br>

              How vast are your Ways <br>
              You Search me <br>
              You know me <br>
              You formed my inward parts <br>
              You know me <br>

              I praise you <br><br>

              Our sons turn their faces <br>
              And daughters run from grace <br>
              My heart is broken for them <br>
              That they may not know you <br>
              That they may choose destruction<br>
              I am scared for my Child<br>
              Being raised in this culture<br>
              I pray for wisdom<br>
              I pray for grace<br>
              Help me to raise my child well<br>
              I pray you adopt them into your fold<br>
              How do I be a father<br>
              In a nation without them<br>
              Mothers are picking up the slack<br>
              And I know that I give much slack<br>
              Help me to be compassionate<br>
              Help me to know you are God<br>
              To know that you are good<br>
              And we are unworthy<br>
              But in your goodness<br>
              You have made me worthy<br>
              By the spilling of your blood<br>
              You have opened your veins<br>
              And because of Christ<br>
              I rest in your grace.<br><br>

              I keep running <br>
              I keep on searching<br>
              I may never<br>
              Find my way<br><br>

              What grace is this you've given me<br>
              And yet he gave Himself freely<br>
              You count my steps<br>
              You know my inward thoughts<br>
              You gave yourself<br><br>

              How vast are your Ways<br>
              You Search me<br>
              You know me<br>
              You formed my inward parts<br>

              Still my thoughts, my anxiety<br>
              Remind me that you are God<br>
              And that you are in control<br>
              Help me to complete the task in front of me<br>
              Providing for my wife, and my kids<br>
              Lord, help me to finish this race strong<br>
              Help me to share your Gospel<br><br>

              Galatians 4:4-7<br>
              But when the fullness of time had come,<br>
              God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, <br>
              to redeem those who were under the law, <br>
              so that we might receive adoption as sons. <br>
              And because you are sons, <br>
              God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, <br>
              “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son,<br>
              and if a son, then an heir through God.<br> <br>

              Lord, I struggle to know that you are God <br>

              How can I put them to death?<br><br>

              I am restless and need to rest in you<br>
              Lord, I want to be free,<br>

              I am restless and need to rest in youv
              Lord, I want to be free,<br>

              If I am a slave to my sin<br>
              I may just give in.<br>
              I may give into my depression<br>
              God, take these chains<br>
              They seek to hold me back<br><br>

              I feel like these demons<br>
              Are sitting on my chest<br>
              I lost my friend<br>
              And somehow I feel like I will lose you<br>
              I’m really not that great<br>
              I turn everyone way<br>
              And you tell me I don’t have to be good enough<br>
              I know that’s why you sent your son<br>
              But sometimes it’s hard to think<br>
              When you feel so far from me<br>
              When will you take me out of the miry clay?<br>
              Have mercy on me God<br>
              I don’t know how much more I can take<br><br>

              Help me to see the light<br>
              I’ve been walking around so blind<br>
              Graves continue to line the ground<br>
              That I walk<br>
              And everywhere I turn<br>
              I can’t run from your sight<br>
              I’ve been walking around so blind<br><br>

              Help me to see the light<br>
              I’ve been walking around so blind<br>
              Graves continue to line the ground<br>

              I can’t run from your sight<br>
              I’ve been walking around so blind<br><br>

              I am restless and need to rest in you<br>
              Lord, I want to be free,<br>

              I am restless and need to rest in you<br>

              Help me to see the Light<br><br>

              John 8:12<br>
              Again Jesus spoke to them, saying,<br>
              “I am the light of the world. <br>
              Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, <br>
              but will have the light of life.”
